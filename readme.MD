## Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains implementations of various computer algorithms in Python. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate file and can be run independently.

### List of Algorithms

1. Genetic Algorithm: The `ga.py` file contains an implementation of a genetic algorithm. The algorithm demonstrates how a genetic algorithm can be used to solve optimization problems through selection, crossover, and mutation operations.
